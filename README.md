# Challenge the coder

This is the solution of the programming exercise given by Aivero AS (https://gitlab.com/aivero/public/programming-exercise).

The actual ROS node is located in `scripts/listener.py`. Although the code is not very complex, comments have been provided for easier understanding.

The launch file has been edited, allowing the test to be executed by `roslaunch programming_exercise run_for_test.launch`.
